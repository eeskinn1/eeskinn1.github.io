## Voltage Regulator Selection

|<img src="https://github.com/eeskinn1/eeskinn1.github.io/blob/main/Assets/Component%20Selection/LM2576HVS-3.3.jpg?raw=true" width="200"> <br> [LM2576HVS-3.3](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/umw/LM2576HVS-3-3/16705917) <br> - $8.45| - High Voltage Input <br> - 3 Amp output <br> - Easier to solder size | - Lower Efficiency (75% @ 3.3V) |

|       Solution 2       |     Pro       |     Con       |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
|<img src="https://github.com/eeskinn1/eeskinn1.github.io/blob/main/Assets/Component%20Selection/LM2674M-3.3.jpg?raw=true" width="200"> <br> [LM2674M-3.3](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/LM2674M-3-3-NOPB/287129) <br> - $3.97 | - 86% efficiency @ 3.3V <br> - Cheapest <br> - Easy to hand solder design  | - 500mA output  |

|       Solution 3       |     Pro       |     Con       |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| <img src="https://github.com/eeskinn1/eeskinn1.github.io/blob/main/Assets/Component%20Selection/LM2676S-3.3.jpg?raw=true" width="200"> <br> [LM2676S-3.3](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/LM2676S-3-3-NOPB/363809) <br> - $5.72| - 86% efficiency @ 3.3V <br> - 3A Output | - Lower input Voltage |

The LM2676S-3.3, Solution 3 is the optimal choice because it provides a high 3A output while maintaining 86% efficiency, reducing
heat generation and power loss. Its 260 kHz switching frequency allows for smaller inductors and capacitors, making the design more
compact and responsive to load changes compared to the lower-frequency LM2576HVS-3.3. While the LM2674M-3.3 is efficient, its 500mA limit is too low for my needs.

|<img src="https://github.com/eeskinn1/eeskinn1.github.io/blob/main/Assets/Component%20Selection/MCP6562T-E-SN.jpg?raw=true" width="200"> <br> [MCP6562T-E/SN](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MCP6562T-E-SN/1680916) <br> - $0.76 | - Faster response time <br> - Push-pull output <br> - 1.8V to 5.5V | - Low Voltage range <br> - Higher power consumption than TLV7022 |

The LM393DT is the best option for my application. The LM393DT is a low-power, high-precision dual comparator with open-collector output. It offers a wide supply voltage range, making it ideal for signal detection and sensor interfacing in compact, reliable systems. Its low offset voltage ensures stable performance. The fact that it is such a commonly used comparator means there will be ample resources for implementation.

|       Solution 3       |     Pro       |     Con       |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
|<img src="https://github.com/eeskinn1/eeskinn1.github.io/blob/main/Assets/Component%20Selection/SN74HC165DR.jpg?raw=true" width="200"> <br> [CD74HCT597M96](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/onsemi/MC74HC165ADR2G-Q/23329450) <br> - $1.16 | - Integrated Storage Register <br> - Parallel Load Feature <br> - 3.3V compatibility | - Most expensive <br> - Less Common <br> - Higher Power Consumption |

The SN74HC165DR is a great choice because it allows 8 digital inputs to be read using only three microcontroller (PIC) pins, significantly reducing GPIO usage. It operates at high speed, making it well-suited for applications requiring fast data transfer. Additionally, at just $0.22, it is a very cost-effective solution for expanding digital inputs.

|<img src="https://github.com/eeskinn1/eeskinn1.github.io/blob/main/Assets/Component%20Selection/HC-SR04.jpg?raw=true" width="200"> <br> [HC-SR04](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osepp-electronics-ltd/HC-SR04/11198533) <br> - $5.95 | - Easy to set up  <br> - Not Light dependent| - Expensive <br> - Slowest response time |

The HiLetgo Infrared Emitter and Receiver is an excellent choice due to its high accuracy in detecting objects, making it ideal for precise ball-tracking applications. It also has a fast response time, ensuring real-time detection without significant delays. Additionally, at $0.55 per pair, it is cost-effective for implementing multiple detection points within budget. However, it requires proper alignment between the emitter and receiver, which may add complexity to installation and calibration.

## Microcontroller Selection

The class of microcontrollers that we will be using is an 8-bit Microchip PIC microcontroller
which has many forms and pin counts. This brand of microcontroller is appealing because of
prior experience with this component. My responsibilities in this project is the sensing capabilities. So I will be using a series of 8 pairs of Infrared receivers and emitters to sense the passing of a metal ball prior to the activation of an electromagnetic coil causing the ball to accelerate. Because there is no digital sensor in our plans I am required to add a PISO Register Shift Chip in my components. So the infrared sensor will go to an ADC then to the chosen shift register then to my PIC microcontroller.

The PIC18F47Q10 provides ample pins for this configuration, and my MCC setup shows that each peripheral is allocated to dedicated pins with no overlapping assignments. Additionally, by matching the peripheral requirements with the microcontrollerâs available pins, we ensure communication and programming while maintaining flexibility for extra GPIO if needed. Overall,  my MCC configuration indicate that there are enough pins for all intended functions and no apparent errors in the pin assignments.
