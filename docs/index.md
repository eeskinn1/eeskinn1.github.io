## Design Project

My name is Evan Skinner I am an ASU student pursuing a bachelors
in Electrical Engineering. This webpage will serve as a repository for the
files, work and photos of my design project for EGR314.

## Project Role

My role in this project is the Sensing subsystem. My system will sense, using Infrared light, the rolling ball in order to activate the Magnetic coils on time and calculate the speed of the ball.
