## Under Development as Assignments are Completed

## Appendix A: Ideation and Concept Generation 

Brainstorming Notes:

1. What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?

Utilization of colors, bolding, and verbal direction will allow for easier use of the device. 

2. How do you plan on designing your "controls" (see page 4 and 6 of the pdf for "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits")

Design interactive controls that are simple, intuitive, and provide clear visual or auditory feedback to minimize user errors and ensure ease of use. Place controls ergonomically and ensure they are durable, accessible, and suitable for both individual and group interactions. 

3. What role will durability, safety, and comfort play in the user experience?

Durability and safety are the largest concerns for any potential design concept. The target audience may not understand, or care, how to properly use the exhibit which may lead to injury, the destruction of the exhibit, or both. To combat this, any design must have some sort of failsafe and level of mechanical strengthening to ensure child safety. The role of comfort

4. What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device? (see page 5 of the pdf for "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits")

Instruction should be kept to a minimum and be easily understandable to accommodate the younger end of the target audience. Any necessary instruction will be accommodated with simple, non cluttering labels as well as a human systems approach to the control scheme. 

5. Ideas or strategies for avoiding each of the five common pitfalls mentioned in ("Designing Science Museum Exhibits with Multiple Interactive Features: Five Common Pitfalls")

- Divide the exhibit into smaller, standalone modules to avoid complexity.
- Ensure the purpose of the exhibit is immediately clear and intuitive to users.
- Build a system that highlights when components need servicing.
- Use audio, visuals, and tactile components to accommodate various learning styles.
- Keep interactions brief and engaging to hold attention.
