## Team Charter

As a team, we are each dedicated to acting quickly and efficiently to stay ahead of deadlines whether internal
or external. We will all demonstrate an affinity to the common goal in creating a STEM themed system that will 
demonstrate a complex scientific concept in a captivating way. Each team members' subsystem will interact with 
the others in a complete, purposeful manner to accomplish our agreed upon goals. Success in this endeavor will consist with completion of the collective project and confidently presenting the final product. Success also looks like each team member coming away from the class with more expertise and knowledge than they came with. The professional, effective communication and collaboration is also a shared goal among all members who all share the same interest and motivation in engineering.

The creation of this Charter was defined in part through the discussion of our team goals. As previously mentioned, professionalism, communication, and collaboration are key however our team also has more product centered goals. Some of these goals include...

1. Our product in at minimum thirty different schools across the country
2. Low end consumer cost for an increased likelihood of integration in the classroom
3. Easily replaceable parts with a right to repair philosophy
4. An engaging product with a high percentage learning outcome among students
5. Durability/Build Quality strong enough to withstand a five foot fall

## Product Statement

Our mission is to design a modular, web-enabled, interactive STEM-themed display that demonstrates a 
scientific or engineering concept, inspiring K-12 students through hands-on learning and seamless 
integration with a UART daisy chain network.

## Communication Channels

_Table 1: Preferred Team Member Communication Modes_

| Name      | First Choice Communication | Second Choice Communication | Third Choice Communication |

| Kirk Volin  |         Discord     |          Text Message     |        Zoom    |
| Hunter Hassebroek|    Discord     | Text Message     |     Zoom | 
| Noah Brent  |     Text Message     |     Discord     |     Zoom     |
| Evan Skinner  |  Discord  |    Text Message    |      Zoom       |

The team will communicate via Text message or Discord and is expected to communicate in a professional 
and polite way. The team will work hard to be responsive, efficient and timely in all communications 
in person or otherwise. Instructor correspondence should be summarized to every other member in a 
clear and concise way. Differing opinions should be settled in a cordial way and any violations of the 
teams commitment to professionalism and decorum will be called out and reported to the instructor if 
deemed necessary.

## Conflict Resolution

As a team we agreed that differences in opinion are expected and the healthy and polite discussion is vital 
to the efficiency and forward motion that the project demands of us. We agreed that definitive project goals 
and responsibilities are imperative to keeping progress organized and high quality. The team agreed that to 
resolve any conflict team members should be prepared to apologize and compromise with others in the event of 
a conflict. Once again professional and considerate discussion is the only tone of discussion permitted, so 
once this tone has been violated and no intention of reestablishing this tone is in sight then any team member 
is expected to contact the instructor. The instructor will either serve as a mediator to resolve conflict or 
pursue disciplinary action against necessary parties.
